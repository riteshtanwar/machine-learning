Abstract

This report presents the design and development of an Electricity Price Prediction System, which aims to forecast future electricity prices using historical consumption data and machine learning techniques. The system integrates a full-stack web application with a robust machine learning backend to provide real-time, data-driven insights for stakeholders. The backend is developed in Java using Spring Boot and RESTful APIs, while the machine learning model is built using Python and scikit-learn. A Flask microservice hosts the model and communicates with the Java backend. The system also incorporates a MySQL database for persistent storage and a user-friendly frontend for interaction.
The increasing complexity and volatility of electricity markets necessitate accurate and timely price forecasting to optimize energy production, distribution, and consumption. This project presents an Electricity Price Prediction System that leverages machine learning techniques to model and forecast short-term electricity prices. By analyzing historical price data along with influencing factors such as demand, weather conditions, and market trends, the system employs algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict future electricity prices with high accuracy. The proposed solution aims to assist utility providers, grid operators, and consumers in making informed decisions, improving operational efficiency, and reducing costs. Evaluation results demonstrate that machine learning models, particularly deep learning approaches, outperform traditional statistical methods in capturing the non-linear patterns of electricity price dynamics. This work highlights the potential of intelligent systems in enhancing the reliability and profitability of modern energy markets.

Introduction
Electricity price forecasting has become a critical component in the operation and planning of modern energy systems. With the liberalization of electricity markets, prices are no longer regulated and are subject to fluctuations influenced by various dynamic factors such as demand and supply, fuel costs, weather conditions, and grid stability. These fluctuations present challenges for power producers, suppliers, consumers, and policymakers, who rely on accurate price predictions to make informed operational and financial decisions.
Traditional methods for electricity price prediction, such as time series analysis and statistical models, often struggle to capture the complex, non-linear nature of price behavior in competitive energy markets. In contrast, machine learning (ML) techniques offer advanced capabilities in pattern recognition and data modeling, making them well-suited for this task. By learning from vast amounts of historical and real-time data, ML algorithms can detect intricate trends and relationships that are difficult to model using conventional approaches.
This project aims to develop an Electricity Price Prediction System using various machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of price forecasts. The system utilizes features such as historical price data, demand forecasts, weather patterns, and market indicators. By implementing and comparing models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the study evaluates their performance in predicting short-term electricity prices.
The integration of machine learning into electricity price forecasting not only enhances prediction accuracy but also supports smarter energy management, better grid reliability, and more cost-effective strategies for stakeholders across the energy value chain

3. Literature Review
Various studies have highlighted the importance of electricity price prediction for demand-side management and grid optimization. Machine learning models like linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks have been widely adopted due to their ability to identify patterns in complex data. Integration of such models in web-based systems has also gained traction for providing accessible and actionable insights.
3.1 Related Work
Several academic and industrial efforts have shown the efficacy of predictive analytics in the energy sector.

6 Machine Learning Methodology
The core of the system lies in its machine learning model. The process involves:
•	Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering historical electricity price data, consumption data, and other relevant factors (e.g., weather conditions, time of day, day of week). Preprocessing steps may include cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies. Normalization scales the data to a standard range, preventing certain features from dominating the model training process. Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones to improve the model's ability to capture relevant patterns. High-quality data is essential for building an accurate and reliable prediction model.
•	Feature Selection/Engineering: Identifying the most relevant features that influence electricity prices. This could involve statistical analysis, domain expertise, or feature selection algorithms. Common features include:
o	Hour of the day
o	Day of the week
o	Historical load data
o	Weather conditions (temperature, humidity)
o	Time of year/seasonality
o	Economic indicators
o	Energy source mix (renewable vs. fossil fuels)
o	Demand forecasting
o	Market prices of fuels (natural gas, coal)
o	Carbon emission allowances
•	Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning model for time series forecasting. Several algorithms can be employed, including:
o	Regression Models: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression
o	Time Series Models: ARIMA, SARIMA
o	Machine Learning Models: Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU)
•	Model Training and Validation: Training the selected model on a portion of the historical data and validating its performance on a separate dataset. This process involves optimizing model parameters to achieve the highest accuracy. Techniques like cross-validation are used to ensure the model's generalization ability and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.
•	Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The choice of metric depends on the specific requirements of the application and the characteristics of the data. Lower values for these metrics indicate better model performance.
•	Model Deployment: The trained machine learning model is deployed as a Flask microservice, enabling the Java backend to send requests and receive predictions. Flask provides a lightweight and flexible framework for deploying machine learning models as web services. This allows the model to be easily accessed by other parts of the system.
